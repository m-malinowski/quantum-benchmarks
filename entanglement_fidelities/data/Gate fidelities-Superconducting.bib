abstract = {Demonstration of quantum entanglement, a key resource in quantum computation arising from a nonclassical correlation of states, requires complete measurement of all states in varying bases. By using simultaneous measurement and state tomography, we demonstrated entanglement between two solid-state qubits. Single qubit operations and capacitive coupling between two super-conducting phase qubits were used to generate a Bell-type state. Full two-qubit tomography yielded a density matrix showing an entangled state with fidelity up to 87{\%}. Our results demonstrate a high degree of unitary control of the system, indicating that larger implementations are within reach.},

abstract = {We present improvements in both theoretical understanding and experimental implementation of the cross resonance (CR) gate that have led to shorter two-qubit gate times and interleaved randomized benchmarking fidelities exceeding 99{\%}. The CR gate is an all-microwave two-qubit gate that does not require tunability and is therefore well suited to quantum computing architectures based on two-dimensional superconducting qubits. The performance of the gate has previously been hindered by long gate times and fidelities averaging 94-96{\%}. We have developed a calibration procedure that accurately measures the full CR Hamiltonian. The resulting measurements agree with theoretical analysis of the gate and also elucidate the error terms that have previously limited gate fidelity. The increase in fidelity that we have achieved was accomplished by introducing a second microwave drive tone on the target qubit to cancel unwanted components of the CR Hamiltonian.},

abstract = {Hardware efficient transpilation of quantum circuits to a quantum devices native gateset is essential for the execution of quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers. Typical quantum devices utilize a gateset with a single two-qubit Clifford entangling gate per pair of coupled qubits, however, in some applications access to a non-Clifford two-qubit gate can result in more optimal circuit decompositions and also allows more flexibility in optimizing over noise. We demonstrate calibration of a low error non-Clifford Controlled-{\$}\backslashfrac{\{}\backslashpi{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} phase (CS) gate on a cloud based IBM Quantum computing using the Qiskit Pulse framework. To measure the gate error of the calibrated CS gate we perform non-Clifford CNOT-Dihedral interleaved randomized benchmarking. We are able to obtain a gate error of {\$}5.9(7) \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} at a gate length 263 ns, which is close to the coherence limit of the associated qubits, and lower error than the backends standard calibrated CNOT gate.},

Furthermore, we introduce a process map representation in the Pauli basis which is visually efficient and informative.

@article{Kjaergaard2020,
abstract = {The equivalence between the instructions used to define programs and the input data on which the instructions operate is a basic principle of classical computer architectures and programming. Replacing classical data with quantum states enables fundamentally new computational capabilities with scaling advantages for many applications, and numerous models have been proposed for realizing quantum computation. However, within each of these models, the quantum data are transformed by a set of gates that are compiled using solely classical information. Conventional quantum computing models thus break the instruction-data symmetry: classical instructions and quantum data are not directly interchangeable. In this work, we use a density matrix exponentiation protocol to execute quantum instructions on quantum data. In this approach, a fixed sequence of classically-defined gates performs an operation that uniquely depends on an auxiliary quantum instruction state. Our demonstration relies on a 99.7{\%} fidelity controlled-phase gate implemented using two tunable superconducting transmon qubits, which enables an algorithmic fidelity surpassing 90{\%} at circuit depths exceeding 70. The utilization of quantum instructions obviates the need for costly tomographic state reconstruction and recompilation, thereby enabling exponential speedup for a broad range of algorithms, including quantum principal component analysis, the measurement of entanglement spectra, and universal quantum emulation.},

@article{Barends2014,
abstract = {A quantum computer can solve hard problems, such as prime factoring, database searching and quantum simulation, at the cost of needing to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction provides this protection by distributing a logical state among many physical quantum bits (qubits) by means of quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is a useful phenomenon in this regard, because it allows the construction of large quantum circuits and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits, the surface code approach to quantum computing is a natural choice for error correction, because it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: the per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99 per cent. Here we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92 per cent and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.4 per cent. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerance threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

@article{Dicarlo2009,
abstract = {Quantum computers, which harness the superposition and entanglement of physical states, could outperform their classical counterparts in solving problems with technological impactsuch as factoring large numbers and searching databases. A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a final state containing the result of the computation. Building a quantum processor is challenging because of the need to meet simultaneously requirements that are in conflict: state preparation, long coherence times, universal gate operations and qubit readout. Processors based on a few qubits have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance, cold ion trap and optical systems, but a solid-state realization has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. We use a two-qubit interaction, tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond timescales, which is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. This interaction allows the generation of highly entangled states with concurrence up to 94 per cent. Although this processor constitutes an important step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be required to fulfil the promise of a scalable technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
