abstract = {Spins associated with single defects in solids provide promising qubits for quantum-information processing and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated long coherence times, high-fidelity operations, and long-range entanglement. However, control has so far been limited to a few qubits, with entangled states of three spins demonstrated. Realizing larger multiqubit registers is challenging due to the need for quantum gates that avoid cross talk and protect the coherence of the complete register. In this paper, we present novel decoherence-protected gates that combine dynamical decoupling of an electron spin with selective phase-controlled driving of nuclear spins. We use these gates to realize a ten-qubit quantum register consisting of the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center and nine nuclear spins in diamond. We show that the register is fully connected by generating entanglement between all 45 possible qubit pairs and realize genuine multipartite entangled states with up to seven qubits. Finally, we investigate the register as a multiqubit memory. We demonstrate the protection of an arbitrary single-qubit state for over 75 s-the longest reported for a single solid-state qubit-and show that two-qubit entanglement can be preserved for over 10 s. Our results enable the control of large quantum registers with long coherence times and therefore open the door to advanced quantum algorithms and quantum networks with solid-state spin qubits.},

abstract = {Precise control of quantum systems is of fundamental importance in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and high-resolution spectroscopy. When scaling up quantum registers, several challenges arise: individual addressing of qubits while suppressing cross-talk, entangling distant nodes and decoupling unwanted interactions. Here we experimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype spin qubit system consisting of two proximal nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. Using engineered microwave pulses, we demonstrate single electron spin operations with a fidelity Fâ‰ˆ0.99. With additional dynamical decoupling techniques, we further realize high-quality, on-demand entangled states between two electron spins with F{\textgreater}0.82, mostly limited by the coherence time and imperfect initialization. Crosstalk in a crowded spectrum and unwanted dipolar couplings are simultaneously eliminated to a high extent. Finally, by high-fidelity entanglement swapping to nuclear spin quantum memory, we demonstrate nuclear spin entanglement over a length scale of 25 nm. This experiment underlines the importance of optimal control for scalable room temperature spin-based quantum information devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Quantum computation provides great speedup over its classical counterpart for certain problems. One of the key challenges for quantum computation is to realize precise control of the quantum system in the presence of noise. Control of the spin-qubits in solids with the accuracy required by fault-tolerant quantum computation under ambient conditions remains elusive. Here, we quantitatively characterize the source of noise during quantum gate operation and demonstrate strategies to suppress the effect of these. A universal set of logic gates in a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond are reported with an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 0.999952 and two-qubit gate fidelity of 0.992. These high control fidelities have been achieved at room temperature in naturally abundant 13 C diamond via composite pulses and an optimized control method.},
