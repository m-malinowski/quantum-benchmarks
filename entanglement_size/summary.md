## FAQ
### Why does a datapoint have a question mark?
The preprint in question, Moore2021, claims to have measured the largest GHZ state observed to date. The claim relies on a new method of measurement result post-processing (referred to as QREM in the paper). Therefore, it is reasonable for this technique to be verified before the record is "confirmed". I hope to add the point once the paper passes peer-review. The other best result, Pogorelov2021, is also a preprint, but uses a well-established and simple read-out technique. Therefore, it is included without the question mark.

### Which data points are shown in these plots?

The plots show the largest numbers of genuinely entangled qubits across different platforms.

### When is entanglement genuine?

This is a [notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipartite_entanglement). Experimentally, it requires the fidelity with respect to the target maximally entangled state to exceed 50%.

### Does the Year refer to the date of publication, or the year of the preprint?
For simplicity, it's the year of publication if the paper is already published. 

### What if multiple best results come out in the same year?
The plot only shows the best result from a given year, regardless of the month of publishing.
